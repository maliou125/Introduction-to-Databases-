Document-oriented database
Uses JSON-like documents for data storage
Dynamic schema allows flexible data modeling
Scalable, distributed architecture
Support for high availability and horizontal scaling
Slide 3: SQL (Relational Database) Features

---------- SQL (Relational Database) Features ----------


Relational database management system (RDBMS)
Tabular data storage with rows and columns
Structured schema with defined tables and relationships
ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance for transactions
Mature technology with well-established standards


----------- Comparison: MongoDB vs. SQL ------------


Data Model: MongoDB uses a document-oriented model,  ************   while SQL uses a relational model.


Schema Flexibility: MongoDB offers dynamic schema, allowing flexible data modeling, ***********    while SQL has a structured schema with defined tables and relationships.


Scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability and distributed architecture,******** while SQL databases can scale vertically or horizontally but may require more effort for horizontal scaling.


Transaction Support: MongoDB supports atomic operations within a single document but does not provide full ACID transaction support across multiple documents. ********* SQL databases offer ACID compliance for transactions.


Use Cases: MongoDB is well-suited for applications requiring flexible schema and scalability, such as content management systems and real-time analytics. ***** SQL databases are often preferred for applications with complex relationships and transactional integrity, such as financial systems and e-commerce platforms.
